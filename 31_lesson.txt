    Two versions: 9 pin, 25 pin model
    Data travels at 115 kilobits per second

Parallel Port:
    Used for scanners and printers
    Also called printer port
    25 pin model
    IEEE 1284-compliant Centronics port

PS/2 Port:
    Used for old computer keyboard and mouse

    It was introduced in 1997
    Most of the computers provide two USB ports as minimum
    Data travels at 12 megabits per seconds

VGA Port:
    Connects monitor to a computer's video card
    It has 15 holes
    Similar to the serial port connector. However, serial port connector has pins, VGA port has holes.

Power Connector:
    Three-pronged plug
    Connects to the computer's power cable that plugs into a power bar or wall socket

Firewire Port:
    Transfers large amount of data at very fast speed
    Connects camcorders and video equipment to the computer
    Data travels at 400 to 800 megabits per seconds
    Invented by Apple
    It has three variants:
        4-pin Firewire 400 connector
	6-pin Firewire 400 connector
	9-pin Firewire 800 connector

Modem Port:
    Connects a PC's modem to the telephone network

Ethernet Port:
    Connects to a network and high speed Internet
    Connects the network cable to a computer
    This port resides on an Ethernet Card
    Data travels at 10 to 1000 megabits per seconds depending upon the network bandwidth.

Game Port:
    Connects a joystick to a PC
    Now replaced by USB

Digital Video Interface, DVI port:
    Connects Flat Panel LCD monitor to the computer's high-end video graphic cards
    Very popular among video card manufactures.
