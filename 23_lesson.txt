Non-impact printers
Non-impact printers print the characters without using a ribbon. These printers print a complete page at a time., thus they are also called as Page Printers.
These printers are of two types:
      Laser printers
      Inject Printers

Characteristics of non-impact printers
    Faster than impact printers
    They are not noisy
    High quality
    Supports many fonts and different character size

Laser Printers
These are non-impact page printers. They use laser lights to produce the dots needed to form the characters to be printed on a page.
Advantage
    very high speed
    very high quality output
    good graphics quality
    supports many fonts and different character size

Disadvantage
    expensive
    cannot be used to produce multiple copies of a document in a single printing

Inject Printers
Inject printers are non-impact character printers based on a relatively new technology. They print characters by spaying small drops of ink onto paper. Inject printers produces high quality output with presentable features.
They make less noise because no hammering is done and these have many styles of printing modes available. Color printing is also possible. Some models of Inject Printers can produce multiple copies of printing also.
Advantage
    high quality printing
    more reliable

Disadvantage
    expensive as the cost per page is high
    slow as compared to laser printer
