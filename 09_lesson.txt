Third Generation Computers

The period of third generation was from 1965 - 1971. The computer of third generation used Integrated Circuits (=ICs) n place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry.
The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient. In this generation remove processing, time-sharing, multi-programming operating system were used. High-level languages ( FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL, PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68, etc ) were used during this generation.

The main features of third generation are:
    IC used
    More reliable in comparison to (the) previous two generations
    Smaller size
    Generated less heat
    Faster
    Lesser maintenance
    Costly
    AC required
    Consumed lesser electricity
    Supported high-level language

Some computers of this generation were:
     IBM-360 series
     Honeywell-6000 series
     PDP (= Personal Data Processor)
     IBM-370/168
     TDC-316
