Second Generation Computers

The period of second generation was from 1959 - 1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper (or: since they were cheaper), consumed less power, more compact ins size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.
In this generation, assembly language and high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, were used. The computer used batch processing and multi-programming operating system.
The main features of (the) second generation are:
    Use of transistor
    Reliable in comparison to (the) first generation computers
    Smaller size as compared to (the) first generation computers
    Generated less heat as compared to (the) first generation computers
    Consumed less electricity as compared to (the) first generation computers
    Faster than (the) first generation computers
    Still very costly
    AC required
    Supported machine and assembly languages

Some computers of this generation were:
     IBM 1620
     IBM 7094
     CDC 1604
     CDC 3600
     UNIVAC 1108
