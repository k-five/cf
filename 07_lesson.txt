First Generation Computers
The period of first generation was from 1946 - 1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (= Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. Therefore, they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it.
In the generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punchcard, paper tape and magnetic tape were (not was) used as input and output devices. The computers in this generation used machine code as the (? the) programming language.
The main features of the first generation are:
    Vacuum tubes technology
    Unreliable
    Supported machine code language only
    Very costly
    Generated a lot of heat
    Slow input and output devices
    Huge size
    Need of AC
    Non-portable
    Consumed a lot of electricity

Some computers of this generation were:
     ENIAC
     EDVAC
     UNIVAC
     IBM-701
     IBM-650
