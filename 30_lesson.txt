13. Computer Fundamental -- Memory Unit

Memory unit is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit. This storage capacity is expressed in terms of Bytes.
The following table explains the main memory storage units:
1.  Bit (Binary Digit)	     A binary digit a logical 0 or 1 representing a passive or active state of components in an electric circuit.
2.  Nibble		     A group of 4 bits is called nibble.
3.  Byte		     A group of 8 bits is called Byte. A byte is the smallest unit, which can represent a data item or a character.
4.  Word		     A computer word, like a byte, is a group of fixed umber of bits processed as a unit. which varies form computer to computer but is fixed for each computer.
    			     The length of a computer word is called word-size or word-length. It may be as small as 8 bits or or may be as long as 96 bits. A computer stores the information in the form of computers words.

The following table lists some higher storage units:
1.  Kilobyte  KB    1 KB = 1024 Bytes
2.  Megabyte  MB    1 MB = 1024 KB
3.  Gigabyte  GB    1 GB = 1024 MB
4.  TeraByte  TB    1 TB = 1024 GB
5.  PetaByte  PB    1 PB = 1024 TB



14. Computer Fundamental -- Ports

A port is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer. It can be programmtic docking point through which information flows form a program to the computer or over the Internet.

Characteristic of Ports:
A port has the following the characteristics:
    External devices are connected to a computer using cables and ports.
    Ports are slots on the motherboard into which a cable of external device is plugged in.
    Examples of external devices attached via ports are the mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone, speakers, etc.
