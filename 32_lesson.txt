15. Computer Fundamental -- Hardware

Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be seen and touched.
Example of hardware are the following:
    Input Device: keyboard, mouse, etc.
    Output Device: printer, monitor, etc.
    Secondary Storage Device: Hard Disk, CD, DVD, etc.
    Internal Components: CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.

Relationship between hardware and software:
    Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output.
    Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.
    Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.
    To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.
    Hardware is one-time expense.
    Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.
    Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.
    A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.
    If the hardware is the 'heart' of the computer system, then the software is the 'soul'. Both are complementary to each other.
