Fifth Generation Computers

The period of fifth generation is (from) 1980 till date. In the fifth generation, VLSI technology became ULSI (= Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components.
This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (= Artificial Intelligence) software. AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which interprets the means and methods of making computers think like human beings. All the high-level languages like C, C++, Java, .NET and etc are used in this generation.

AI includes:
   Robotic
   Neural Network
   Game Playing
   Development of expert systems to make decisions in real-life situations
   Natural language understanding and generating

The main features of fifth generation are:
    ULSI technology
    Development of true artificial intelligence
    Development of natural language processing
    Advancement in Parallel Processing
    Advancement in Superconductor technology
    More user-friendly interfaces with multimedia features
    Availability of very powerful and compact computers at cheaper rates

Some computers types of this generation are:
    Desktop
    Laptop
    Notebook
    Ultrabook
    Chromebook
