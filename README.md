### Computer Fundamental. New vocabulary for Intermediate English Learner

This is a complete lesson/approach for you who want learn and improve your vocabulary in computer area.  
I divided [this e-book: Computer Fundamental](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/) to 44 lessons.
Each lesson contains:
- a section of the e-book for reading  
- some new vocabulary to review
- and an audio file (= `.m4a`) for that section that you can listen to

Thus you have a single e-book (= `.pdf`) format, 44 lessons in `.txt` format and 44 audio files in `.m4a` format.

What you should notice is that I am a learner like you and still I am learning.
And I did these for myself. and liked to share it with others, like you :)

I recorded the audio files with my Tablet (= Tab-2. Samsung) in a busy/noisy neighborhood.  
So I am sorry if you hear any around-me noise. I tired my best -- sometime recording a file
more than 10 times -- but it is not so bad.

---

The `.csv` file contains all that new vocabularies plus definition of them and plus a log of examples.
Example from the Advanced Oxford Dictionary and from the e-book as well.
Also `.odt` version is for you who want to print it or modify it for yourself.
Although I added a `.pdf` version of the **odt** version, but still you can choose what you want.
