Other Base System to Non-Decimal System
Step 1. Convert the original number to a decimal number (base 10).
Step 2. Convert the decimal number so obtained to the new base number.
Example:
octal number: 25 (base: 8)
step 1. convert to decimal
(see the related table)
octal number 25 (base: 8) = decimal number: 21 (base: 10)

step 2: convert decimal to binary
(see the related table)
decimal number 21 (base: 10) = binary number: 10101 (base: 2)
octal number 25 (base: 8) = binary number: 10101 (base: 2)

Shortcut Method -- Binary to Octal
step 1. Divide the binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right).
step 2. Convert each group of three binary digits to one octal digit.
Example:
binary number: 10101 (base: 2)
(see the related table)
binary number 10101 (base: 2) = octal number: 25 (base: 8)

Shortcut method -- Octal to Binary
step 1. Convert each octal digit to a 3-digit binary number (the octal digits may be treated as decimal for this conversion)
step 2. Combine all the resulting binary groups (of 3 digits each) into a single binary number.

Example
octal number: 25 (base: 8)
(see the related table)
octal number: 25 (base: 8) = binary number: 10101 (base: 2)

Shortcut Method -- Binary to Hexadecimal
step 1. Divide the binary digits into groups of four (starting from the right)
step 2. Convert each group of four binary digits to one hexadecimal symbol.
Example:
binary number: 10101 (base: 2)
(see the related table)
binary number: 10101 (base: 2) = hexadecimal number: 15 (base: 16)

Shortcut Method - Hexadecimal to Binary
step 1. Convert each hexadecimal digit to a 4-digit binary number (the hexadecimal digits may be treated as decimal for this conversion)
step 2. Combine all the resulting binary groups (of 4 digits each) into a single binary number.
Example
hexadecimal number: 15 (base: 16)
(see the related table)
hexadecimal number: 15 (base: 16) = binary number: 10101 (base: 2)
