Fourth Generaton Computers

The peroid of fourth generation was from 1971 - 1980. Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (= VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5,000 transistors and other circuits elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made is possible to have microcomputers of (the) fourth generation.

Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable and affordable. As a result, it gave rise to Personal Computer (= PC) revolution. In this generation, time sharing, real time networks, distributed operating system were used. All the high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE, etc were used in this generation.

The main features of this generation are:
    VLSI technology used
    Very cheap
    Portable and reliable
    Use of PCs
    Very small size
    Pipeline processing
    No Ac required
    Concept of the internet was introduced
    Great developments in the fields of networks
    Computers became easily available

Some computers of this generations were:
     DEC 10
     START 1000
     PDP 11
     CRAY-1 (Super Computer)
     CRAY-X-MP (Super Computer)
